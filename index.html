                                Served allows users to input current ingredients to generate recipes based on what they already have at home. Each recipe generated from their selected ingredients shows a thumbnail of the recipe, the percentage of which it matches the ingredients the user has listed and a heart button at the bottom of the card to "save" their favorite recipes for later use.

                                Saved recipes are reachable with the button in the upper right section of the page. There are also buttons in the navigation menu to see the developers and report bugs/issues with the site.

                                This app is a simple calendar used for a single work day, allowing the user to type to-do items in each hour. The current hour will show up as red, past hours will be grey, and future hours will be green.

                                It uses Moment.js to display the current date and time, and local storage to keep to-do items from disappearing upon closing the tab in the user's browser. The user can very easily keep track of their own tasks from their local file system, though the live website is editable by anyone.

                                This is a simple weather recording app that will display the weather of any city put into the search query. The temperature, UV index, humidity, and "feels like" temperature of the current day will appear, as will the forecast for the next 5 days.

                                This app is a wedding budget planner, allowing the user to create budget items, budget categories, to-do lists, and see their data displayed as estimated/actual costs through pie, bar and line graphs. Users can edit, delete, and add these items, which route to an API built with Express, Node, and Sequelize.

                                The MySQL database holding user data is run on my computer through MySQL Workbench, and deployed to Heroku with JawsDB. The graphs are built using Chart.js, accounts are created with user authentication via Passport.js, and repository updates are screened by ESlint and Travis CI before being pushed to the main branch.
